03/29/2017-3404864SunTrust Bank     Loan# 0280358136    As you know I have this loan since 2009.    Last Year in July I place the house for sale, in less than 24 hours I had a contract in the house.  The closing was set to be done on Sept. 9th. A few days before the closing the buyer's attorney let me know we had a problem with the documents from the house and they were canceling the deal.   At that time I had resigned to a twenty four year job and I had sold or gave away almost all I had in the house.  Attached you will find the full story.    This is a huge problem for me because I can't sell the house and at the time I moved to Florida.  I don't see how this problem can be solved.  I need your advice and help with this issue.  You can contact me at 954 661-1748  Email address: gaviota48@outlook.com or mercedesf@gmail.com    Mercedes Francia  >> Mercedes Francias purchased 1580 Turner Branch Rd., Goodview, VA May, 2009. At the time of purchase (please refer to attached supporting documents), owners and lenders title insurance were purchased by Ms. Francias issued by Stewart Title.    Bobby Heffinger, the next door neighbor, has at one time owned the land Ms. Francias home is currently on and he cut of a portion of it and gave it to his daughter who sold the property and home to Ms. Francias. In order for Mr. Heffinger's daughter to sell the property that the home was on, she had to have a new septic and new well drilled to go with the home before she sold it, which she did.  Mr. Heffinger at that time had a survey redrawn in 2008 showing the new well and septic on his daughter's property so she could sell it. Apparently the well needed to be deeded to his daughter by a "deed of conveyance" and it was not done this way, was passed by an easement.  In 2011 Mr. Heffinger financed his property in a reverse mortgage when his wife died and when his !reverse mortgage ender recorded the deed the legal plat agreement on record was the survey from 1998 showing the original property lines (the portion of the property that has Ms. Francia's storage  building and well on).  All of this was discovered when Ms. Francias had sold the property in 2016 and the new buyer's attorney said this was never recorded properly by deed of conveyance and the only proper plat on record is the original plan from 1998 showing Mr. Heffinger as the owner of the property where Mr. Francias' well it, not the one where the lines were redrawn in 2008. Mr. Heffinger's lender of his reverse mortgage included the original property in his new mortgage and now  Ms. Francias' does not have a well on her property and the property is 1/2 the size of what she originally purchased.  A 3rd party company hired by Mr. Heffinger's mortgage company to resolve title issues has been trying to resolve the issue but the easy resolution seems to be a well easement but Mr. Heffinger is not willing to sign the well easement which states the well is on his property and he is responsible for the maintenance an upkeep of the well shared with Ms. Francias. Mr. Heffinger says this is not a resolution and the well is on Ms. Francias' property she purchased but according to the title work and plat on record it is not.  I have attached the latest survey that was done in 2008 showing an exchange of parcels and a previous survey that was done in 1998 on our subject property.  The exchange shows that the Heffingers (neighbors) conveyed parcel 1 and 2 to the Huffs (subject property) and the Huffs conveyed parcel 3 to the Heffingers. However, no deed of exchange was recorded to convey title. (see title work from when the Francia's home was sold in Sept. 2016 but  never was consumated due to this property dispute).\N4/7/17,uvme5,,email sent to legal-Miki & Ed for assistance  4/12/17,uvme5,sent follow up email...for status,..email response from Micki - she's having someone look at this ,client may need to hire an attorney..Micki hopes to have more info as soon as possible....added e/m to r-drive  4/17/17,uvme5 email response from Dawn Tuppounce ,advising info has been forwarded to Stacey Robinson to review as well...  4/20/17,uvme5,called Ms.Francia  @954-661-1748 advised of docs needed..copy of title work & survey & any correspondence she received from the buyers attorney,,ms to try to fx docs by Friday-4/21/17.  4/21/17,uvme5,21 page fax received forwarded to Dawn Tupponce,copied Ed,Eric,Renee Brooks,Stacy l.

The client was advised it can take up to 30 days for the bureaus/agencies to update their records, but she confirmed with the case owner that Experian has already made the update now.4/5/2017 3:20 PM 417-872-6612 Acknowledgement call - I left a voice mail. # HMD    4.13.17-determined per the research above that the client should have received a response from Experian regarding the denial for her credit dispute; however, since the client indicated someone at ST was supposed to inform her of the outcome, we will need to speak with the client to determine if any teammate error was involved.  -Reviewed card 1514:  it shows it was opened 8-23-15; it was closed 7-5-16 and then reopened in July 2016, with a charge on 7-25-17; &, the card is still open.  -Reviewed credit card system for card 1514:  it shows the card on the cbr credit reporting screen as being reported as paid & closed 7-5-16.  -Reviewed prior sf cases/credit disputes submitted: case 3076920 was denied in oct 2016 by r seward; credit dispute 3274407 for Equifax was denied; credit disputes 3258956 and 3258957 for Transunion (completed by j reed), and credit dispute 3287118 for Experian on 2-7-17 (completed by j reed) was denied.  -Determined that, based on the above research, there could be an issue with the card being open and the credit reporting screen (cbr in the credit card system) showing the card as paid and closed 7-5-16.  -Submitted research request 7194164:   this was done to see if we need to revisit the denied credit disputes and/or to see if there is some code credit card can place on the card to show the card as active/so it will report as such to the bureaus.    4-14-17-Left voicemail for client at 4178726612; she called back and verified her highschool/herself.   -per client: She did not state who promised a call back to her about the decision of the credit dispute but said this has been ongoing for months. She mentioned the issue with the credit limits of 1500 on the new card 1445, and the 4000 credit limit on the original card 1514 that was closed in july 2016 before she found out the new card would not have the 4000 limit on it. ..however, the issue for this case is the card not reporting and this not being updated by an unknown teammate/no follow up as promised..I told the client I will call her back with the outcome.  -Reviewed card 1445; it was opened on 7-5-16 and is also still an active/open card but has the credit limit of 1500.  -Reviewed research request 7194164 to credit card dept., and it was re-directed and now has 1 business day for the response to be provided.    4-17-17-Reviewed research request placed to credit card, and it still says 1 day to respond...waiting on a reply.  -sent task to gp, mgr, to review to determine if case should be closed as is, or we wait for credit card to respond to see if they need to get involved with credit disputes to revisit the denial decision made (in case she does not see an issue with the reporting).  -emails with gp manager: gp responded confirmed via email that we should wait to hear back from credit card before going to credit disputes. (case owner responded via email as well).    4-18-17-Reviewed research request system: it now shows that request 7194164, redirected to request 7198236, & redirected to request 7201398 on 4-17 is being completed-they are updating a code on the card so the acct will report as "active" with the bureaus.  -Determined bank error with reporting of card to bureaus in July:  (per research request response) there was an issue with the code not being updated properly back in July when the card was reopened, causing the card not to be reported correctly.  -Determined credit disputes should have contacted the LOB or reviewed the credit reporting issues previously (in prior credit disputes filed) to resolve the client's issue sooner.  -Determined no issue with a teammate  for this case-no teammate name provided/no notes.  -Emails with gp, manager.    4-19-17-emailed credit card mgmt.  4-24-17-spoke with client/emailed credit card/sent jb task for ce override.  4-25-17-confirmed w credit card via email the correct code was placed & emailed gp.57

04/04/2017-3416641What happened  Product:  Mortgage: Home equity loan or line of credit  Issue:  Loan servicing, payments, escrow account  Describe what happened:  Last July 2016, after 2 years of trying, I filed a consumer complaint to have the primary name changed on my equity line. With your help that was finally accomplished. This January 2017, I refinanced my primary mortgage and paid down the equity line by $180,000, leaving a balance of approximately $33K. when I received my first bill for the new payment in March 2017, the primary name was reverted back to my ex-husband and the loan payment did not have the interest only option, which was always an option for my account and which I verified with the bank during my refinancing. I had even received my new monthly payment for the interest only which was part of the qualification process. the primary name needs to be changed and the interest only option made available. Now I am receiving notices that I am past due in my payment and wondering if it has been reported against my credit score. Please help.  Concerned about foreclosure?

SunTrust is a federally registered service mark of SunTrust Banks, Inc.  [ST:XCL]We have received and reviewed your correspondence forwarded to us from the CFPB regarding the name of the borrower and the terms of the above referenced account. I appreciate the opportunity to respond.    In reference to the name of the primary borrower on the account, it was changed from Lawrence Bagwell to your name in November 2016. However, in December 2016, it reverted back to Mr. Bagwell#s name. We have updated our records to reflect that you are the primary borrower. I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this matter may have caused you.    Regarding the payments terms for your account, our records show that, on   January 20, 2017, we received a payment of $180,120.45. Because there were no instructions as to how the payment was to be applied, it was processed as a regular payment. This means that it was applied to principal and interest.     As of February 14, 2017, the Draw Period ended and the account entered its Repayment Period (See Term on page 1 of the enclosed Access 3 Equity Line Account Agreement And Disclosure Statement). As a result, the balance of $32,271.48 was moved to a fixed rate for 10 years.  The payment that was credited to the account on March 13, 2017, did not satisfy the March payment; therefore, a late fee was assessed. However, on March 28, 2017, as a courtesy, the late fee was waived. Copy of statement enclosed.    We have also reviewed your concerns about the negative reporting of this account. While we understand your concerns, we are required to report credit information accurately to the credit reporting bureaus. For this reason, the late reporting will remain.         SunTrust strives to provide exceptional service with each and every client interaction, and we recognize that we did not meet these expectations in this situation. Your comments are very important and were shared with the appropriate management team.    Ms. Bagwell, I understand this is not the resolution you are seeking from SunTrust. Should you have any other questions, please contact us via your Online Banking Profile or call us at 800.SUNTRUST. A representative will be glad to help you.4/5- 1.56pm- left ackn vml @ 8048733550 - jgm  4/18/2017 -email from 3/29/2017-name has been corrected on account-regarding payment client sent in payment did not indicate how it was to be applied, processed as a regular payment, P1001 (principal) and INT02 (interest).

04/06/2017-3421229What happened  Product:  Consumer Loan: Vehicle loan  Issue:  Managing the loan or lease  Describe what happened:  This is a complaint about Suntrust. My car was totaled, other party was 100% negligent, other party's insurer, State Farm, paid fair market value and my insurer, Progressive, paid the difference to pay off car loan entirely. During this time, I received daily harassing phone calls, often before 9am ET, from Suntrust's collections department. Each and every time I assured them that the car was totalled and the entire payoff amount was already issued by State Farm and Progressive and provided account numbers supplied by those insurers. Suntrust demanded that I pay my monthly payment directly to them, offering to refund the difference when they processed those checks, and threatening to damage my credit if I did not pay immediately over the phone. On the last such call, Suntrust verified that they received payment and said the account was paid in full. Today I see that my credit report now shows a Delinquency for $0. I find this to be insulting and abusive treatment.  Attachment    Desired resolution  Desired resolution:  I should never had had my credit damaged. Suntrust has created a credit dispute on my behalf. I would like to have my credit repaired immediately, but apparently my credit will be damaged for at least 30 days from today, assuming the disputed charge is removed. Suntrust could perhaps also offer to pay for free credit reporting for me for a year or something similar.

Because we did not receive your February 10, 2017 payment in a timely manner, a late payment fee was assessed to the account on February 17, 2017 and reporting was made to the credit bureaus accordingly. For this reason, we regret that we are unable to comply with your request to remove the reporting.    If you have any documentation or written correspondence that you believe would provide evidence that current reporting is inaccurate, please forward it to me at our address or fax number noted above. We will be glad to review any additional documentation you send us regarding this issue.    In regard to your concerns about collection calls, please note that Federal regulations permit calls to be made between 8 a.m. and 9 p.m. local time, and that all calls were made within this time frame.

Going to review with Amy some more on this file.  Daughter pays a lot of bills.She is not going to pay-off the car it has zero interest rate.  Her daughter has her loan with STM also.

Reason for this is that the 12 months bank statements show that Holly(daughter#s) income is being deposited into the bank account and car payment is being paid from the statement.  No money from our client is being used to pay this payment. I will touch base with the client today before I leave to let them know we are working on this and we will have an update in a couple days.    4/19/17 uvsb177 per email from Pat Reilly, Yes Suellen assisted me yesterday with underwriting questions.  We will be reviewing the loan this morning to see if we can move forward.  Client expects me to call with final resolution this week.  Will update you later today.  - Pat Reilly  advised the loan is approved and she will call the client to advise; the debt is not the borrower debt it's the daughter.  She will update me once she speak with the client.    4/20/17 uvsb177 per the email from Steven Sachs, The client never responded back to Patti#s call#s yesterday.  Will have the processor call today to try to schedule closing with the client.    4/21/17 uvsb177 per the email from Shawn Caldwell, processor, the closing date is set for 5/2/17 @ 6:30.      Complaint:    Client is unhappy with the processing of their loan being told yes they are approved to Ooops, our underwriters made a mistake, loan denied.    Findings:    Due to the time zone difference Pat Reilly, agreed to communicate with the client.  Pat work with the underwriter and figured out the debt is not the borrower debt, it belongs to the daughter who#s paycheck also is being deposited into the account.

You bank is funding a loan for Brent Alexander Parris and Mehruba Anwar, a lovely young couple in their residency as Doctors here in Miami.

And I really don't want my sellers to sue the buyers. They are ALL nice responsible caring people and don't deserve to be given the run around like this.    Please, we need you to step up and take a look at what is going on inside of your Bank. I hope to hear from you.

04/12/2017-3435381Please open a case and assign to Kara. Details are below in yellow.    This was a prequalification, so should be a MERT case - it came through with a deposit account # and the feedback was very vague, so workflow determined to be CARRT.      This case was re-assigned to CCAMO from the original MERT case 3414063. I don't believe this is actually a CCAMO compliant.  The submitter cited the complaint against  TM Jason Moss who is a Mortgage Loan Consultant and his manager is Cheryl Taylor and her title is Mtg Sales Mgr-Non Producing. What should we do with this?\NLO: Jason N Moss     **Old case complaint: Teammate Interaction Challenges || Client felt teammate didn't respond quickly enough and was rude and inconsiderate telling client that "you have to do what you have to do."  Case 3414084    4/12/17-uvkc77- made 24 hr call; left msg; closed contact milestone    4/12/17- uvkc77- client called back; stated that the LO was nice at first and their communication was mainly through text messaging. After awhile the LO stop responding; client requested new LO at branch and never heard back. After client called LO and left voicemail and mentioned going to BBB; LO called right back but with an attitude and told him STM didnt have the system capability for the product he was requesting. Cleint was upset that he did not communicate this prior as the LO knew he was on a timeline; client stated he would take his business elsewhere in which the LO replied "you have to do what you have to do". Client did speak with LO's mgr, Cheryl and she apologized and said she would coach him on his behavior.  He stated at this point he has been pre-qualified with another lender for the TN housing product and is in process of being pre-approved but was not declining STM offer if we are still available to do it. I advised i'll look into this and get back w/him and apologized for the LO's lack of communication and customer service.    4/12/17- uvkc77- sent email to LO mgr, Cheryl Taylor and her mgr, Brian Bills - for more info on this product and if we can assist  client or not    4/14/17- 4:40pm - uvkc77- called client to go over resolution; someone picked up but no one would respond.

We are not able to provide the THDA 15k product he wants due to system constraints and I explained that to him.  So if he still wants that product, we don#t have it at this time.

Updates usually take about 90 days.  I am unsure of how far along they are but we are hopeful that it won#t take much longer.  Given his troubles with us already, I really don#t want to even take his loan in without this being totally installed first.  I did tell him that as well.  I also offered that if had issues with the other lender to call me personally and I would try to help or possibly be ready with this programming.

04/12/2017-3436076What happened  Product:  Mortgage: Conventional adjustable mortgage (ARM)  Issue:  Application, originator, mortgage broker  Describe what happened:  Applying for a mortgage at suntrust bank, I met with Jim Litle my loan officer. The plan was to convert my home equity line into a mortgage 7/1 with a fixed rate. The application process started 12/2016, was able to lock in a rate 1/ 2017, for 3.7%. with $10,000 cash out. Projected closing date 2/2017. Met with Jim Litle, on several occasions going over paper work, noticing my cash out each time was less, mentioning everytime why?? Answered by the time you close you would of paided down your loan so everything will work out. Having put my faith in Jim Litle, never questioned more. Dateds where made for closing ,but canceled twice and rescheduled. But the day of closing, my cash out was $4000 less, than expected..He said those were back taxes, since we didn't close the loan within a certain time. Which he postponed the closing twice, and mentioned he had to pay for the lock-in rate, which really shouldn't have been told to a customer. After the closing, my equity line payment for March was taken out of my account. I thought the loan was already paid off..since I add a closing , so what happened there? So when I called Jim Litle, to inquire why money was taken out of my account without my authoriztion , he said it must of crossed over, I questioned and said it should of been closed on the closing day..So funds would not be taken out of my account without my authorization, since the loan was paid off.. Jim Litle said it is my respondibility to notify the equity line to stop payment. But again I was not informed of this valid information, that would of prevented this to happen.. When trying to speak with Jim Litle, to review why this all happened he just angry and hung up the phone, Just didnt want to talk to customer after the fact..Very PROFESSIONAL!!! I was told I would get my funds returned in 5 buisness days that was on 3/27/2017, and still waiting.. and also waiting for my HUD statement which was not given to me on my closing day.. After inquiring on the delay of my funds, the check was cut on 4/12/2017, for the amount of $748.00, less $100.00.. again mis-informed....

My overall experience for this Mortgage very dissatisfied, deceptive information. I would never recommend SunTrust, this company is not very LOYAL / TRUSTWORTHY to their customers.    Finding:  After reaching out to SunTrust teammates, here are the responses.  Jeff Harris, sales manager, the client neglected to stop the auto draft prior to closing. For some reason, she thought it was Jim#s responsibility to stop the payment. She began aggressively calling him and making demands. She even used the Facebook FaceTime app at 7 AM to try to reach him. He called her back during business hours that morning. He then contacted the servicing department twice on her behalf to inform them of the problem and work to resolve. He even filed an expedited refund request along with the Branch Manager to help return the funds sooner (they initially quoted 10 days and said the expedited request would reduce to 5 days). He spoke with her numerous times. He did say that he had to end one conversation abruptly when she would not stop yelling at him.  ( see full email in the r:drive) as well as attached to Salesforce    From the bank side:    The below email stated a payment amount of $950.00 was drafted from clients account.  The actual amount drafted was 854.41 on 3/25/2017.  It is the clients responsibility to cancel the auto debit as we do not have the capability or authority to do so. The title co asked for a payoff quote on 3/16/17 and on the check stub is shows good through 3/24/17.  They did not mail it out until 3/27/17 Fedex and it was received on 3/28/17 which is the date the payoff was applied. The overpayment check the client received in the amount of $748.95 was due to the difference in days of interest.  I hope I have explained it for the clients understanding along with the writing on the attached documents.  If you need anything else please let me know.

Your letter indicates that my case is considered closed and resolved. There are a few things that need to be gone over before we can formally close this case.    I will need you or preferably your manager to call me by the end of this week. If you cannot meet that time frame, I will elevate this (in my own words) to the highest level of your companies management team to see if they can assist me. Providing the later happens and I am not satisfied with their response, I will need to consider presenting the details of my experience to entities outside of your organization.

He states the clients were threatening to the processor because she wouldn't send for final but we could not because assets weren't there. At the beginning, clients stated they were getting gift from mother but she ended up backing out.

He was given instructions at origination & again 2 weeks post origination that he would need to pay off a Capital One auto loan to lower his debt ratio.  He stated that he would be receiving funds from the sale of another REO on 2/28 and would utilize those funds to pay off that debt; however, he instead moved from WV to Florida & proceeded to spend the funds he obtained from the sale of his property until those funds had dissipated.  He no longer had funds to close so he sold the vehicle to pay off the loan and then made numerous attempts to obtain gifted funds from family members who refused to assist.  He finally obtained a gift from a personal friend/church member on 4/10 and the contract expired on that day.  The seller refused to extend the contract, as they had already extended twice before.  I received a phone call from the selling realtor on Monday, 4/10, and she stated that the buyer/our client kept making numerous calls to the seller in spite of being asked to stop calling.  She also said the seller would have been willing to extend the contract if the buyer would not make further contact with her and would pay her April mortgage payment on a new property she had purchased.  He refused to comply with either request.  He was informed by the realtor that the seller would be canceling his contract and he continued to send text messages to me late that evening refusing to acknowledge that the contract was being canceled & blaming his realtor if he did end up #losing his dream home#.  He had already signed a contract cancelation document at that point and had been given his EMD.    This was an extremely difficult client throughout the entire loan process and he even accused me of lying about his credit score at one point because he had his own report through Credit Karma. Please let me know if you need any additional information."    4/13/17- FROM LO MGR, JoDee Lambert:   "Unfortunately we cannot force a seller to extend a contract and we cannot force an approval when a borrower does not have acceptable verification of funds to close.  The uw has very clear and detailed notes in Empower about her concerns w/ cash deposits and being unable to properly source those as acceptable funds to close.  Additionally there were inconsistencies in the documentation that raised red flags it appears from uw comments."    4/13/17 - FROM LO, Sherry Frank: "One last note on this file.  The borrower did not have a phone of his own, so we were given his then fiancé#s cell phone number as a means of contact.  After the origination of the 2nd loan file, the borrower & his fiancé had a domestic dispute and she informed me that she would be backing out of the purchase contract and that there would be no way to reach him, as he relied on her phone for contact.  Several days lapsed and they resolved their differences and were back together; however, we were not able to communicate with the borrower during that time period.   "57

The customers debt is $1506.53.  In looking at what is mentioned below which we looked at which is $2,246.17 income from the school system and $939.57 which is using the 2016 W2 income and YTD is how the income calculator calculates $2,246.17 + $939.57=$3,185.74.  If you manually look at her debt  $1506.53/$3,185.74=comes to 47.28% which the DU system came back approve ineligible as we have to have the debt under 45%.       I used the more conservative approach in my final calculation which came to 51.73%, but I also looked at using the higher number which was $939.57 and the debt was still too high 47.28%.  I also gave her the most that I could with the school salary which I only had a letter to go off of but I still looked at the higher amount of $2,246.17.          I then came back to the LO to see if there was any other income and I got a handwritten 1099 which I could not use and the customer told the processor that this last income 1099 2016 was paid under the table.  Hope this helps.  Thanks   "57

04/18/2017-3447941My name is Marvin Bernhagen, my wife's name is Karen and we are writing this letter to respectfully ask for a  goodwill deletion of our recent 30 day late payment on our loan #0204733745.  I began this process by verbally and then in writing requesting a goodwill deletion through your dispute  department. They determined that" filtillmlWJ'll11idmil!, they would not reverse their position of  reporting us "not more than 2 payments" late. In an attempt to further explain our position, I spoke with one of  your Supervisors, a Ms. Raquel Kelly today and she indicated that I should contact your office in writing  Here is my side of the story:  I never indicated to your customer service representatives verbally or in writing that I thought Suntrust had made  an error. I simply pointed out that I have been a reliable and faithful customer for over 10 years, with an excellent  payment record and asked that they reassess their decision to severely punish my wife and I for an honest mistake  that was corrected as soon as we became aware of it.  Here is a recap of the circumstances surrounding my late payment:  # For the last year or so the password to my on-line account has been blocked and we have been unable to  access our account to pay the bill and review our status. As a result, I have been making payments using  your phone service.  # I had made a mental note to pay the March payment before the end of the grace period which also  coincided with my payday. Unfortunately, it slipped my mind.  # The first idea I had that we were 30 days late was when a credit monitoring service we subscribe to  texted us an alert. I immediately called the customer service department (April 7, 2017), paid the March  Payment and the .April payment (which was still within the April grace period) and brought the account  completely current including all late charges.  # As a good faith gesture and to assure you that we would not get in this position again I offered to set my  account up for automatic withdrawal.  I do realize that you have policies in place regarding reporting to Credit Bureaus but I also know that it is possible  for you to remove items at your discretion. I would appreciate it if you would contact the three credit bureaus on  our behalf and allow us this one time courtesy deletion.\N04/14/17  10:51:26 EMZ  CREDIT BUREAU DISPUTES INVESTIGATOR RESPONDED TO DISPUTE CASE#3438751                                             ********************DENIAL REASON*****************    LOAN REVIEWED THRU DISPUTE CASE#3424535 ON 4/11/17  PER NOTES BELOW...NO AUD DUE TO PREV AUD SENT  RESPONDED TO DISPUTE CASE#3424535                                             ********************DENIAL REASON*****************    REVIEWED LOAN AND PMT HIST AND BRWR 3/17 PMT WAS       RCVD 4/7/17 WHICH CAUSED THE DELQ..THIS WAS NOT A      BANK ERROR...BRWR WILL RCVD DENIAL LETTER....EM57

She wanted to make sure that someone was aware of the situation with the teammate in underwriting she spoke with. My apologies for clicking the wrong button with the follow up. I was off on Thursday and missed the first email to respond./I replied asking for teammate's name and what the feedback is  - Feedback: I do not have the teammates name. It was the person calling to go over the counter offer for her application for her HELOC.  She recently lost her husband and is in the process of settling his estate and we were moving her relationship back to SunTrust from Langley Federal Credit Union. She applied for a 50,000 loan and they counter offered for 18.  When she spoke to the teammate on the phone she says he was very rude and condescending to her. She felt he was discriminating against her now that she was a single woman the way he was explaining it to her.. Main keywords she kept bring up were Rude, Discriminating and she felt like he was making it seem like she was a bad person or #doing something wrong# when he was talking to her.  She mentioned she was glad he told her that the conversation was recorded so someone else could hear how it went. /Email to Carly Curry  - Feedback that matter being reviewed  - Feedback: I reviewed the call, and Steve was very patient with the client.  He explained what we could offer and asked if that would work for her.  The client went on and stated that she is not 100% happy with SunTrust because she feels every time she tries to do something with us we have gone up on our rates; however, it was obvious these comments were based on past experiences. The client stated that she felt insulted by the offer. Steve explained that we not only consider equity but ability to pay as well, and we never want to put the client in a position that may jeopardize her home.  Client mentioned that she has had a line with us before and she paid as agreed. Steve explained that the situation may have been different at that particular time regarding the income level; however, he did not insinuate who, why or what made the difference. The client stated that her husband was on the request before. Although they had more income, she stated they had more debt.  Steve informed her that if she changes her mind to give him a call back. The client stated that she was not going to move forward and hung up. She was not happy./Opted in for compliance review due to discrimination57

Discrimination was not an issue. From what I gathered, Faye had come in some time ago to set up what she thought was a POD account. Mariah Duggins was the teammate who opened the account incorrectly. The account was opened as a joint account with survivorship instead of an individual account with a POD as requested. Mariah was technically still in training at the time. The client had been back in the branch before to try to remedy the situation and get the account fixed due to bank error. When she came in on Monday, she requested our personal banker (who was on lunch), so I offered to assist. The woman was disrespectful, inappropriate and using expletives right off the bat. She wanted the account switched to an individual account with POD, but also wanted to add POA. There were issues with the POA documents she brought in (not registered with the court), so I phoned the Help Desk for assistance. I instructed her on what she needed before we could proceed and I tried to assist as best I could, but when she started swearing at me, I had to step away to maintain my composure. She and the friend who was with her got up and walked out. She came back in at least twice later on. She was slamming her umbrella down in the lobby and creating an unpleasant scene for all of our team and our clients. Courtney Warfel, the personal banker, tried to assist her further, but she was hateful to her as well. As far as I know, there was no discrimination, so please excuse my clicking that category. Hope this helps!    PS: Jonathan Kreeger is no longer with SunTrust. Our new branch manager is Kyla Murphy. Thank you!57
